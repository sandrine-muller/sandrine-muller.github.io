## PROFILE
### Evaluating new data sources through a RAG system
Biomedical researchers develop new data sources to improve the quality of their research. However, they often lack the knowledge and expertise to structure them so that they can be easily reused by the community. We propose a **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system to help researchers evaluate new data sources of their choice according to the FAIR standards in an automated way.
