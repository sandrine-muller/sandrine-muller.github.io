## The Biomedical data Translator
### User engagement and impact
The Biomedical [Data Translator project (NIH/NCATS)](https://ncats.nih.gov/research/research-activities/translator/about) seeks to revolutionize disease biology understanding by developing a robust and interpretable machine learning framework that translates complex biomedical data into actionable insights. In a federated and distributed framework, the platform makes recommendations of biological mechanisms involved in diseases to researchers from different disciplines. In this project we aim at improving **the answer quality** suggested by AI models by recruiting specialists in the field, running a series of experiments and collecting data on their answers. Our use cases workflow will help build **coherent, unbiased benchmarks** for model training and evaluation while promoting usage of the plateform within our communities.
